Later they verified this data in the field. This process is followed to create soil polygon data. On the other hand, soil sample points data (soil chemical and physical properties data added as attributes to this point) are collected by using handheld GPS with an accuracy of (+-) 5 m. \nLater, BARC created GIS data from this upazila wise soil map of SRDI and matches upazila’s edges for whole country. Thus, this soil related GIS data is created through adding locational intelligence to it by BARC. BARC also performed spatial analysis on this spatially corrected data to create crop suitability maps. ",

Later they verified this data in the field. This process is followed to create soil polygon data. The quality of the data is compromised due to hand digitization.\nOn the other hand, soil sample points data (soil chemical and physical properties data added as attributes to this point) are collected by using handheld GPS with an accuracy of (+-) 5 m.\nSRDI will purchase Survey of Bangladesh’s data to enhance and add value to it’s Upazila soil maps.",
